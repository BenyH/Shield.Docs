Proxy Configuration
===================
After installing Ericom Shield, the system is ready to use. In order to start browsing securely using Ericom Shield, the Browsing Traffic should be sent to the Ericom HTTP proxy.

For information on how to integrate Ericom Shield with an existing proxy server, see the `Ericom Shield Deployment Guide <../deploymentguide/postinstallationsteps.html>`_.

Using the EricomShield Service
==============================

The EricomShield service provides the ability to easily perform certain actions on the Ericom Shield system, using a terminal window directly on the host or connected via SSH.

The following actions are available using the service:

*	**start**: starts the service
*	**stop**: stops the service
*	**status**: shows the status of the system
*	**version**: shows the system version
*	**restart**: restarts the service

The required syntax is systemctl <command> ericomshield for example::

	$ systemctl status ericomshield
