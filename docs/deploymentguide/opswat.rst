Ericom Shield includes a third-party scanning engine as part of the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) Server.  This scanning engine integrated into the ICAP Server using CDR which helps secure your web traffic and extend the protection of your organisation against advanced threats by scanning and sanitizing any files that pass through it. 

CDR stands for “Content Disarm and Reconstruct”, this engine is designed to deconstruct the file and remove any content that can cause potential harm (both known and unknown threats).  Once the file sanitization is complete, the sanitized file is sent to the user.

.. note:: Any scanning engine available today cannot provide 100% protection from malware.  In essence the scanning engine reduces the risk, and therefore any protection policy should include a combination or black and white listed sites and CDR to obtain a higher level of overall protection.
