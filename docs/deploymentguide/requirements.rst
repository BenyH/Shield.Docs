Software Requirements
=====================

Ericom Shield requires Linux Ubuntu 16.04 and above.

Hardware Requirements
=====================

Minimum hardware specifications are 64GB memory, 8 core processors and 40GB disk space per shield server.



.. note:: A higher spec machine will host more virtual containers and therefore more browser sessions.  For example 50 cores and 140GB would support approx. 350 virtual containers.
